A bi-directional operator is a pair of tensor functions (F, G), where

    F : (X_1, \dots, X_k) -> Y
    G : dY -> (dX_1, \dots, dX_k)

dX_i has the same shape as X_i, dY has the same shape with Y.

realise is a function that takes a symbolic model and generates a physical model,

    realise : SM -> PM

realise can take traits: including

    batch_size :: optional<int>
    forward_only :: bool

realise<Some<b>> generates a trainable physical model of batch size b
realise<None, true> generates a inference physical model without batch
