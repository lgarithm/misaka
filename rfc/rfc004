Operators
======

Operators should be implemented as plugins.

bulitin operators:
add
mul
softmax
xentropy

Bulitin operators candidate
incr
conv
pool
relu
rbf
mean
batch_combinator
sum

Operator should have a forward tensor function, 

F : (T_1, \dots, T_r) -> S (where r is the arity of F)

and an optional backward tensor function:

G|_{(T_1, \dots, T_r), S} : dS -> (dT_1, \dots, T_r)
