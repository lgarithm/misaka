Higher order functions
======

A train operator has the following signature

```
train : Image -> Model -> Label -> Loss -> Model
```

i.e. give an image, a label and a loss function, a new model will be returned.

In gradient descent algorithm, the train function can be rewritten as:

```
train' : Image -> Model -> Label -> Loss -> Grad
```
were Grad is the gradient, and new model will be `m - g`.

the last step can be rewritten as
```
learn : Grad -> Model -> Model
```

A predict operator has the following signature

```
pred : Image -> Model -> Label
```

i.e. give an image and a model, a label will be returned

Image is a tensor, Label is a distribution vector of finite dimension.
Loss a real function, i.e.

```
loss : \mathbb R^n -> \mathbb R^n -> \mathbb R
```

where n is the number of classes.
